# Cruise and Launch Control Arduino

This repository is made to give my car cruise control and launch control.
Everything is made for Arduino.

I will not share how I made it possible to get the values from the car needed to get everything working. (that's my knowlegde and my knowlegde only :) )

## Components used
The components I use are: TM1638, 20x4 LiquidCrystal LCD, MCP4725 DAC converter, 2 relays

All of these parts make it possible to have cruise control for my Ford Fiesta MK6 2002-2008.

## The code
All the code has been written by myself, no ChatGPT, no crappy copy paste nonsense.
